# Cricket-Scorecard

On this project we try making a Cricekt Scorecard, where we can enter Team Names, Player Names and host a virtual match.
We are going to make this as close as we can to an actual Scorecard, might add features like calling out names and the results also sneak in a commentary here and there.
